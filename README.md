# Docker Template for a Full Stack app

This project uses Docker Compose to define and run a multi-container application consisting of a frontend, backend, and MongoDB database.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. Then, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

From the project directory, run the following command to start the application:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

This will build and start the frontend, backend, and MongoDB containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## About Docker Swarm and Kubernetes

Docker Swarm and Kubernetes are both popular container orchestration tools that can help you manage complex container deployments.

Docker Swarm is an open-source platform for container orchestration that is popular for its quick setup and ease of use. It is a native mode of Docker and excels within smaller apps with fewer containers ².

Kubernetes, on the other hand, is an open-source platform for managing containers and their workloads. It is currently the most popular container orchestration tool on the market and is ideal for complex apps that can benefit from automatic scaling ².

Here are some key differences between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes:

| Feature                | Docker Swarm                                       | Kubernetes                                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Installation and setup | Easier to install and configure ¹                  | More complex to install and configure ¹                          |
| Ease of use            | Easier to pick up ²                                | More difficult to learn ²                                        |
| Scalability            | Excels within smaller apps with fewer containers ² | Ideal for complex apps that can benefit from automatic scaling ² |

## Minikube

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. It runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a virtual machine on your personal computer. This allows you to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day without needing access to a cloud provider or installing additional software.
